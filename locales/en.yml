      item1:
        p: >-
          In many traditional PoS systems, long-term token holding and
          verification may lead to the concentration of interests and the
          vulnerability of the network. DPoC needs to reduce the number of
          current token holdings to obtain greater accounting power, which
          reduces the risk of oligopoly control and increases the degree of
          decentralization of the network.

      item2:
        p: >-
          In many PoS systems, new token reward mechanisms are often adopted in
          order to encourage token holders to participate in verification. This
          can lead to inflation, thus diluting the value of existing token
          holders. DPoC limits the issuance of new tokens through a burning
          mechanism, helping to control inflation and maintain the value of the
          tokens, while also ensuring the long-term sustainability and stability
          of the network.
        t: Protecting the Value of Token Holders
      item3:
        p: >-
          PoS itself has a certain degree of security, and DPoC further improves
          the security standard of the network through its combustion strategy.
          The process of burning tokens actually increases the cost of malicious
          behavior, making any attack or fraud more expensive.
